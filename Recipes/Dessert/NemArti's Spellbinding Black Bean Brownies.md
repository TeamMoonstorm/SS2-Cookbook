# NemArti's Spellbinding Black Bean Brownies

## Ingredients:

- 1 15oz can black beans (aim for no salt/low sodium)
- 1 cup pure date syrup
- 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 3/4 cup rolled oats
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- Semisweet chocolate pieces
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- pinch of salt
- (Optional) unsalted unshelled pistachio nuts, finely chopped or walnuts


## Directions:

1. Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Line an 8x8-inch cake tin with parchment paper or a 9x9 baking tray. You can also use oil/butter/cooking spray instead of parchment paper
2. Drain/rine the black beans. Combine the black beans and date syrup in a food processor and blend until smooth.
3. Add the cocoa powder, rolled oats, baking powder, and baking soda to the food processor and blend until smooth.
4. Add the vanilla extract and salt to the food processor and blend until smooth.
5. Pour the batter into the prepared cake tin or tray and smooth the top with a spatula.
6. Sprinkle the chocolate pieces and nuts (if you have) over the top of the batter.
7. Bake for 25-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. If you used a larger tray you might need a shorter baking time.
8. Ideally allow your brownies to cool on a wire rack (or in the fridge) before cutting into squares. (They will be very soft and crumbly when hot.)
