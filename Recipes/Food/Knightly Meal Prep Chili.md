# Knightly Meal Prep Chili 

- Makes: 5-7 servings

## Ingredients 
- 16oz tempeh (or sub for your protein choice)
- 3 cans of black beans (with the bean liquid)
- 28oz of tomato sauce
- 1 cup veggie broth
- 10oz Mushrooms
- 3 cloves garlic
- 1 Onion
- Olive Oil
- Seasonings: Chili Seasoning, Paprika, Cinnamon, Adobo

## Directions:
### Tempeh:
1. Cut tempeh into small crouton sized cubes
    - Optional: If you want to remove some of the bitterness of tempeh. You can put it in a microwave safe bowl with salted water. Microwave for 3 minutes and drain it. (the bowl will be very hot!! You might need multiple bowls). 
2. Add the tempeh to the pot

### Chili:
1. Cut the onion and mince the garlic to the thickness of your choosing
2. Throw everything into a large pot and bring to a boil. Stirring occasionally as to not burn the bottom. Dont add seasoning yet!
3. Once boiling set heat to low and let simmer until the chili has been reduced to your desired consistency. Make sure to stir periodically so chili contents dont burn (I like mine sludgy so I simmer for 30ish minutes)
4. Season the chili to taste mix it up
5. Put the chili into 5-7 containers and place in Fridge. Can keep for 2 weeks, but loses most of its flavor after 1 week

### Notes:
- We dont add seasonings before reducing because when reducing the chili you can make it overly salty
- We also dont sautee garlic/onion because it can be overcooked in the pot when simmering
