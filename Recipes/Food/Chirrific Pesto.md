# Chirrific Pesto

- Makes: 2-4 servings

## Ingredients 
- 2 cups basil leaves, packed
- 6 tbsp. water
- 4 tbsp. Parmesan cheese, grated (vegan parm also works here too)
- 1/4 cup pine nuts
- 1 tbsp. olive oil
- 3 cloves garlic
- 2 tbsp. lemon juice
- 1/4 tsp. salt
- 1/4 tsp. black pepper
- Pasta of your choice (Fusilli or any pasta with ridges that can capture/keep sauce is recommended)

## Directions: 
1. Wash the basil leaves and pat dry
2. Put all the ingredients except pasta into a food processor or blender
3. Blend the pesto until smooth and the color is a light green. Pesto normally isnt smooth but this recipe is lower on fat so the smoothness has better mouth feel.
4. Store the pesto in a container and set aside in the fridge
5. Cook pasta according to package instructions
6. Drain/rinse the pasta
7. Combine the pesto sauce and pasta. Use as much of the pesto you want, but normally this serving of pesto can coat a whole box of Fusilli
