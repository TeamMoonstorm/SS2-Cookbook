2. Once all the mushrooms are in and heavily cooked, add 400 grams of Heavy Whipping Cream
3. Pour the teaspoon of Chili powder, half a teaspoon of pepper, and salt to taste.

The combination of the Fats and Cream will give your mushroom cream a heat that doesnt overstay its welcome. Feel free to go with more heat if you can handle it.
